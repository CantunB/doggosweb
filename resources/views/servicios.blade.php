                It's your job to keep your dog healthy and safe. Get the facts about grooming, vaccinations, parasite prevention, and first aid.
                Did you know that regularly brushing your dog’s teeth and providing her with a healthy diet and plenty of chew toys can go long way toward keeping her mouth healthy? Many pooches show signs of gum disease by the time they’re four years old because they aren’t provided with proper mouth care-and bad breath is often the first sign of a problem. Give your dog regular home checks and follow the tips below, and you’ll have a very contented pooch with a dazzling smile.

                Sniff your dog’s breath. Not a field of lilies? That’s okay-normal doggie-breath isn’t particularly fresh-smelling. However, if his breath is especially offensive and is accompanied by a loss of appetite, vomiting or excessive drinking or urinating, it’s a good idea to take your pooch to the vet.

                Once a week, with your dog facing you, lift his lips and examine his gums and teeth. The gums should be pink, not white or red, and should show no signs of swelling. His teeth should be clean, without any brownish tartar.
